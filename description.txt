Adds unique accessories for each of the biomes, including the caverns and skies. Each of the Lesser Essences can be upgraded after defeating a boss (so far I've only made 2 of the bosses). These accessories give buffs in their respective biomes and the upgraded versions add special abilities and effects, and can be combined until you achieve the Essence of Terraria, which enables all essence effects no matter what biome you are in.
